	Pre-App
	Application is activated by user 		
	clicking on the Lost Grenadiers' map
	user is connected to server/database
	and is granted access to either a main 
	OSD(on-screen display) of the logo or 
	directly allows the user to start their 
	search the IUS' campus. The end user is 
	graphically marked/start at LF X and Y 
	coordinates/prompt to enter certain 
	field to streamline task. 
	
	Main OSD
	The user is either prompted||fixated on 
	a marker||located with their current 
	coordinates||shown a login screen. Then 
	the a prompt will appear asking the 		    user with their input to certain field/	    attributes/characteristics. The input 	    data will eliminate all the applicable        
	outputs retrieved from the database 
	locally/Internet(web browser). The 
	outputted data will be presented to the 
	user and awaits their response on what 	
	task should be executed (another search 
	query/exit/refine previous search).  

	import library/packages
	//import folium	
	//import pandas as pd
	
	start map centered on a fixed 	
	position of IUS
	//IUS_coordinates = []
	
	instantiate the map on display
	//IUS_map = 

	on-screen map of Life Science(IUS)
	//IUS_map	
	
	Interrupt session with a search menu 
	filters out different entities within
	the data, then the marker will move 
	toward the appropriate 				   
	location(building) and zoom inward to
	the correct output if the search was 
	error/null free. Then the associated 
	text/image data that's available will
	be shown to the user, who then must 
	decide whether to refine/reuse the 			search function||end their access||stay 
	status quo in the background.
