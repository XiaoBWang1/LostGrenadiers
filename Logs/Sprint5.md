Sprint 5

We have received the floor diagram for the Life Science Building, which was very hard and we somehow receive floor plan information on it. We spent a great deal finishing up the ground work of the mapping project on GitHub. The programming language right now points to Python due to its vast array of libraries, versatility, and speed. The framework proposed is Leaflet which is a mapping framework that has GIS features that are still widely used today. Life Science is going to be our sample first building and really the main reason that we started this project. We couldn't meet much during this sprint because everyone was busy but remote working through GitHub is efficient and useful. The Lost Grenadiers' application is about to take off as the database system and coding portion of the project is ready to start.
