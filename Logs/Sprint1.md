Report 1(2 Weeks, Scrum/Sprint 1)

**A team of three of Chris Holley, Matthew Higdon, and Xiao Wang decided on a capstone project. We spent roughly 2 hours forming the basic foundation of the team and the objective of the our future program. Xiao Wang and Matthew Higdon were in the same software engineering class and worked on a project called SnackMap, which assists the end user to find the snack/drink that they want from various vending machine throughout the IUS campus. Another idea that had gained traction was an interactive map that helps with class building/professor/classroom discovery and directions. Both ideas were derived from the root project SnackMap, except with a different approach in its programming language/map framework, functionality purpose, and architectural makeup**
