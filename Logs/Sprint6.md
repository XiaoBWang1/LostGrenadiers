*Sprint 5*

	Made great progress it this sprint as 
	
	the GitHub-based remote hybrid is 
	
	taking off. Received the Life Science 
	
	Building's source map though albeit 
	
	lacking in detail to be honest, but 
	
	it gives us the data needed to start 
	
	coding a demo using the architecture 
	
	mapping of the LF Building. The open-
	
	ticket system is working as efficiency 
	
	is key to allow an open environment for 
	
	all team member to contribute to all 
	
	aspects of the project. We have decided
	
	to use Python as the main programming 
	
	language with Leaflet as the framework 
	
	and Folium as the main library.
